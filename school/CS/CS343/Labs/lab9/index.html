                <h1>Bootstrap Demo - Space Ipsum</h1>
                <p>There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile
                    to
                    us
                    all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation
                    many
                    never
                    come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why
                    climb
                    the
                    highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</p>
                <p>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
                    because
                    they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the
                    best
                    of
                    our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
                    unwilling
                    to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>
                <p>It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low
                    to
                    high
                    gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of
                    the
                    Presidency.</p>
                <p>In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex
                    exploration
                    in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1
                    booster
                    rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent
                    to
                    10,000
                    automobiles with their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket
                    engines,
                    each
                    one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the
                    advanced
                    Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story
                    structure,
                    as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.</p>
